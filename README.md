## Game Description
You See yourself in a little spaceship and need to cross the dangers of a new planet using your navigation and flying skills.

## Project 

This was a very small project that a did it in Unity just to learn basic concepts and learn about the engine, some knowledge that I ,as a developer, gained with this project was:

- Basic Input binding
- Basic Physics (Rigidbody, Collision, etc.)
- Using Audio (Audio source)
- Understand Scenes Managent
- Move Objects using Math. f. Sin () for Oscillation
- How to build the game

## The Course 

I made this Game following the [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) course from [GameDevTv] (https://github.com/CompleteUnityDeveloper2) but I didnâ€™t do exactly as in the course for example me Game doesn't have the 5 levels because my main focus its learn how to use the engine and how to code for it.

But I learn the basics and that was my main objective and I think I understand Unity better now than I did when I began so that Is a win for me.
